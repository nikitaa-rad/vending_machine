# vending_machine

### Design a vending machine in code. The vending machine, once a product is selected and the appropriate amount of money (coins) is inserted, should return that product. It should also return change (coins) if too much money is provided or ask for more money (coins) if there is not enough. Keep in mind that you need to manage the scenario where the item is out of stock or the machine does not have enough change to return to the customer. 25c 50c 1$ 2$ 5$
